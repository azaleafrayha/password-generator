# Password Generator -- **WIP**
This project is based on FreeCodeCamp (FCC) Scientific Computing with Python curriculum. I'm still half my way to complete the project.

## New things I have learned so far:
* **Python module**: How to use `import string`, `random`, and `secrets`. Now I understand that the dot `.` is used to "access" functions inside a module.

* **Variables & Data Types**: The difference between list `[]`, tuple `()`, and string `''`.

* **Looping**: Learned how to use `for _ in range()`. Using an underscore `_` as a throwaway variable when the index isn't needed.

* **Regular Expression (regex)**: The usage of `re.compile()` to prepare search patterns, `[a-z]` for matching lowercase letters, and `[0-9]` for finding digits.

* The difference between `re.search()` (finds the first match) and `re.findall()` (collects all matches)

## Next steps:
Finish the remaining FCC challenges until the password generator can fully validate password requirements (e.g., ensuring it contains at least one number, symbol, etc.)
